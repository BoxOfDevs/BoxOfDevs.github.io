One of our original plugins was an all-in-one core plugin, but a while it ago it went quite outdated. Now, we have started work on a new all-in-one core - named BoxCore! It would combine many other plugins (if their licence allows) into one major core plugin, along with a few unique features! This is our newest plugin with lots of potential.
